# General
- **Poverty is the default state of man**. It is only in the last 200 years that any substantial percentage of humanity has been able to transcend bare subsistence.
- It is far, far easier to create a new, more functional institution than reform an existing one. This applies to political bodies, companies, churches, social groups, and much more.
    - This, incidentally, is why the private sector is more efficient than the public sector.

# Economics
- Prices reflect the interaction between supply and demand, which is to say that **prices reflect relative resource constraints**. Government meddling with price via price caps or floors can't solve an underlying shortage. Price controls shoot the messenger. 
- Prices also implicitly contain an incentive. High prices incentivize more supply and a reduction in marginal demand. Oftentimes **the cure for high prices is high prices**.
- Economic decisions can't be analyzed in a vacuum. Whether a certain allocation of resources is optimal depends on what other options are available. **Opportunity costs are just as real as explicit costs**.
- **Economic decisions rely on highly local knowledge**. You, and you alone, are the highest authority on your own wants and needs. Public policy is most effective when it embraces the decentralized nature of economic decision-making.
    - This is often why central planning fails. Central planners have worse information than those "on the ground". 
    - Private firms do a better job simply because multiple different forecasts of demand are being tested rather than just one.

# Agriculture and Food
- **For most of human history the vast majority of humans worked as farmers**. Subsistence farm labor was so unpleasant that in the early industrial revolution farmers fled the countryside en masse to go work in dirty and dangerous factories.
- Increased agricultural productivity has not only freed billions from the soul-crushing tedium of agricultural labor but has also driven down the price of food considerably. **Food used to be over 60% of a household's budget and famines were common**.
- **Industrial agriculture is the only reason 8 billion humans are alive today**. Traditional organic agriculture is land-intensive and low-yield. If we tried to feed the world without synthetic fertilizers and combine harvesters, billions would starve to death.
- The overwhelming scientific consensus on GM crops is that they are safe and beneficial for the environment. **The hysteria around genetic modification of crops is as pseudoscientific as anti-vax**.
- **Farm subsidies are unnecessary for a country to have a productive agricultural sector**. New Zealand and Australia are major agricultural exporters with virtually no farm subsidies. Farm subsidies are best understood as an incredibly narrow welfare payment to farmers, including the largest industrial farms.
    - **Farm subsidies often raise consumer food prices**. Bioethanol mandates lock up valuable agricultural land. Agricultural protectionism raises prices on imported commodities. Commodity checkoff programs reduce competition.
    - Public stockholding, though common in the 20th century, has been largely replaced by crop insurance and income supports due to the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture discouraging the practice
- The improved quality and variety of food in America compared to 20 years, much less 100 years ago, is staggering and a triumph of globalization.

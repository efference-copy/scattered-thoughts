# Agriculture and Food
## Create a more favorable regulatory environment for new agricultural technology
### Congress should:
- Pass _Agricultural Biotechnology Coordination Act_ and _Biotechnology Oversight Coordination Act_: Create single coordinating office for approvals and reduce duplicative efforts between EPA, USDA, and FDA.
- Pass _Innovative Feed Enhancement and Economic Development Act_: Reclassify non-nutritive animal feed additives (e.g., reduce animal phosphorus emissions, reduce pathogens) to use FDA's Food Additive Petition process rather than the much costlier animal drug pathway
- [Reform EPA's rule for plant-incorporated protectants (PIPs)](https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/food-agriculture-environment/regulations-must-improve-to-help-crops-resist-disease) to harmonize with USDA definition of conventional breeding, narrow scope of plant regulators and disease resistance genes subject to the rule, and reduce unnecessary tiers of exemptions
- [Expand SECURE Rule to a full "red flag" system](https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/food-agriculture-environment/secure-rule-vacature-creates-opportunity-for-usda-to-develop-improved-product-and-risk-based-agricultural-biotechnology-regulations) where only potentially harmful traits on a red flag list are subject to the current approval pathway. This would be technology-neutral and encompass conventionally bred plants as well.
### States should:
- Repeal any state-level restrictions on novel foodtech

## Eliminate farm subsidies and price supports
### Congress should:
- Eliminate farm income supports (ARC, PLC) and subsidized FCIP crop insurance in the next Farm Bill and put savings into Ag R&D (FFAR, AgARDA, NIFA)
    - Second Best: [Eliminate yield exclusion and harvest price option](https://dolanecon.blogspot.com/2018/05/crop-insurance-should-die-yet-it-lives.html)
    - Second Best: Shifts subsidies from crop insurance and income supports to expanding the [term lengths of Marketing Assistance Loans from 9 months to multiple years](https://ifp.org/food-reserves-global-food-security/#u-s-farm-support). This could run afoul of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture's prohibition against public stockholding.
- [End the Renewable Fuel Standard](https://ifp.org/biofuel-mandates-raise-food-and-energy-prices/)
    - Second Best: Set blend requirement window to be multiple years so refiners can take advantage of price fluctuations
- Cut or eliminate agricultural protectionism (high MFN rates on certain commodities, AD/CVD, regulatory protectionism like FSIS continuous inspection of catfish)
- Eliminate all commodity checkoff programs and marketing order programs
    - Second best: Amend 1996 Commodity Promotion Act to mandate a higher percentage of checkoff fees to go to agricultural R&D spending

## Misc food affordability reforms

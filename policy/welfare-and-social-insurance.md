# Welfare and Social Policy

**Note: This document is limited to what I would consider core social insurance programs. Programs that would be better dealt with in a separate doc (UI for labor, Pell Grants for education, etc) will not be included here**

## General thoughts on social insurance

- The main priority of social policy is poverty reduction
- [The definition of poverty is hotly contested](https://dolanecon.blogspot.com/2024/02/redefining-poverty-towards.html). There's a big debate between relative measures of poverty (x% of the median income, like the OECD standard) versus absolute (define a set basket of basic needs as the poverty line).
- Relative poverty is more about inequality than objective living standards. As a measure of well-being it can behave pathologically - recessions can decrease poverty if the median income goes down faster than income in the lowest deciles. It also doesn't permit cross-country comparisons. Those in the lowest 10% of income in the US would be part of the global upper-middle class on an absolute scale.
- Personally I don't care that much about inequality relative to absolute living standards, but there is a steelman case for relative poverty measures:
    - What we consider as abject poverty is often socially determined. A family going hungry is considered appalling today but would be normal in the 19th century. This is especially true re: healthcare, which was far more inaccessible to the poor until relatively recently. That said I think you could reconcile this with an absolute standard that occasionally adjusts rather than a true relative standard.
    - Cash has declining marginal value such that a dollar for a poor person has greater marginal value than a dollar for a rich person. In theory if the administrative costs & deadweight loss of redistribution was low enough, it could be welfare-maximizing to redistribute. While this line of argument is sound in theory, it highly depends on the actual value of those marginal utils and so may not be all that actionable.
    - Very high inequality might contribute to lower social cohesion (this does not appear to be the case in, for example, China so it's at least not a necessary condition) 
- Another problem with relative poverty is that economic development is far more impactful for improving living standards of the poorest than redistribution (ex: China's rise, which pulled a billion people out of poverty, coincided with a huge rise in Gini inequality).
- By any absolute measure [the War of Poverty was a success](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-war-on-poverty-was-a-success). Living standards among the poorest Americans has improved dramatically since LBJ's presidency. The poorest 20-30% tend to do a little worse compared to other OECD countries, but not by much and every other decile is wildly better off.
- Many social welfare programs in the US serve multiple functions that complicate our analysis. Ex: Social Security has a minimum benefit to prevent elder poverty but the program overall is an income-replacing defined benefit pension that pays out mostly to high income/wealth elderly.
- Poverty is also associated with a host of social ills that are unrelated to lower incomes per se, like higher crime rates in poor neighborhoods.
- There is a trilemma for all welfare policy between avoiding work disincentives, providing sufficient income security, and remaining reasonably affordable for the taxpayer.
- Poverty is often a mix of the transient poor (workers who churn between the bottom couple of deciles of income or who have inconsistent work) and the long-term poor who can't and shouldn't work (the disabled, elderly, children in poor families).
- [Some argue that the welfare state solves a market failure in private insurance markets](https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-free-market-welfare-state-preserving-dynamism-in-a-volatile-world/). I'm not sure I agree with that theory, but I think a stronger argument is that strong, efficient welfare states encourage greater risk-taking and threaten economic growth far less than distortionary predistributive measures.

## Ideal Reforms

### Convert all existing welfare programs into a uniform cash benefit, specifically Ed Dolan's Integrated Cash Assistance (ICA) framework
- [Ed Dolan's post on ICA](https://dolanecon.blogspot.com/2020/04/a-social-safety-net-for-age-of.html)
- Main planks
    - A uniform cash benefit that guarantee income up to the federal poverty line (which in this world would not be based on [the highly flawed Official Poverty Measure](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/3/10/23632910/poverty-official-supplemental-relative-absolute-measure-desmond)). The beauty of this approach is that it is agnostic to the cause of poverty; disability, death of breadwinner, a mental health episode, whatever it is you can be sure you won't fall below a certain standard of living.
    - A per-child monthly child allowance that would cover baseline child-rearing costs. Children can't work so increasing the average number of kids mechanically increases poverty.
        - Spending on children almost always has a very high to infinite MVPF.
    - A wage subsidy (monthly EITC) to mitigate work disincentives and improve labor force participation
        - Should be noted that wage subsidies can depress market wages as employers will lower wages and allow the subsidy to compensate. If the goal is getting the very poor into more stabl employment arrangements long-term this might be worth it.
- Rather than means-testing, these benefits would be clawed back via taxes. Contra certain social democrats this isn't costless administratively, as it would make tax returns slightly more complicated for non-poor taxpayers (which is why improving public administration in agencies like the IRS is so critical).
- The existing in-kind welfare system would be dismantled, as cash benefits have much higher [Marginal Value of Public Funds](https://policyimpacts.org/mvpf-explained/what-is-the-mvpf/) since cash is much more flexible.
- All of the onerous administrative burdens on welfare like work requirements, mandatory drug testing, etc would be eliminated. The evidence is strong that these measures reduce uptake of benefits while not actually increasing labor force participation and making programs costly to administer.
    - [Those requirements are politically popular though](https://www.axios.com/2023/05/18/axios-ipsos-poll-work-requirements-medicaid-snap), which is perhaps why other categories of welfare reform (like UI) might be easier.
    - While poverty is multifactorial, it is true that those with poor impulse control tend to be poor (see: [hyperbolic discounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting)). This is a blind spot for those in [the self-control aristocracy](https://induecourse.utoronto.ca/what-do-libertarians-and-pedophiles-have-in-common/).
- Many welfare programs have high EMTR due to aggressive phaseouts, resulting in strong work disincentives. We would want to ensure the phaseouts are gradual to avoid this.
- Needless to say this would require consolidating a number of existing welfare programs and middle class tax incentives, and even then would likely require a VAT (the basis of Europe's higher social welfare spending). [Without any new taxes we only be able to hit ~half of the FPL](https://medium.com/basic-income/how-much-basic-income-can-we-afford-52cc8e9da65).

### Convert Social Security to a forced savings program

- At FRA, each citizen would receive the present value of their Social Security contributions. They could then choose to receive a lump sum (more desirable if the recipient would like to bequeath it) or use it to buy a private annuity to hedge longevity risk.
    - Private annuities are largely crowded out by the existence of Social Security. Relatively few countries have high annuitization rates due to equivalent programs (Chile being an exception, who has a variant of this system)
- Like most public pensions, Social Security has proven brittle to changing demographics. Today's actuarial tables are very different from those when the program was originally stood up. We have a rising dependency ratio combined with a significantly wealthier 65+ demographic.
    - Elder poverty used to be a much bigger issue when most jobs were manual labor and female LFP was low. Now 65+ are the richest age demographic.
    - The ICA approach mentioned above should render the anti-poverty aspect of OASDI obsolete.
- A private annuity market would be more flexible at fairly pricing longevity risk than the SSA
- The US spends far more on the elderly than the young, and Social Security is a major reason why.
- [I'm skeptical that individual accounts invested in the stock market would be a good idea](https://www.cbpp.org/research/would-private-accounts-provide-a-higher-rate-of-return-than-social-security), both because sequence of returns risk could cause unstable fluctuations in the value of the account and because it would naturally result in greater government intrusion in financial markets. There is a tradeoff between social insurance and financialization, and I'd rather financial markets be unimpeded and the average citizen having access to a low-risk retirement.

## Realistic reforms

The ideal reforms are highly unlikely in the near term, so the best marginal step would be making individual social insurance programs more cash-like and higher MVPF.

### SSI/SSDI
- [Improve the DDS's consultative exam process](https://www.niskanencenter.org/how-to-improve-the-social-security-administrations-efficiency/)
    - Poor digitalization ([they use TIFF images and non-searchable PDFs!](https://www.niskanencenter.org/stuck-in-the-fax-age-ssas-record-retrieval-process-needs-a-digital-overhaul/)) means primary care doctors face barriers to serving as consultative examiners for their patients
    - Forcing SSA to adopt TEFCA could help interoperability
- [Base SSI/SSDI benefits in a sliding scale disability rating like the VA's veteran disability benefits rather than the current all-or-nothing approach](https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/4077056-americas-oldest-and-best-disability-benefit-system/)
- [Eliminate $2k asset cap for SSI](https://www.niskanencenter.org/how-stingy-ssi-rules-erode-work-savings-and-family-values/)
    - Congress has a kludge solution, ABLE accounts, with low utilization
    - Savings Penalty Elimination Act would raise cap to $10k and eliminate marriage penalties
- Increase maximum SSI/SSDI benefit to FPL

### TANF
- [We should model TANF after Canada's similar, but far more successful, CHST/CST programs](https://www.niskanencenter.org/inequitable-and-inadequate-reforming-federal-grants-for-state-social-assistance-programs/)
    - Federal support for state General Assistance programs
    - Allocate funding on per-capita basis (TANF allocation is based on AFDC's matching grants, which biases richer, high fiscal capacity states)
    - Index per-capita benefit to inflation
- We should also raise asset limits [since they limit labor mobility](https://medium.com/migration-issues/from-coal-country-to-the-sunbelt-99da39fdc84#.fzextet0v)
- Stricter caps on allocations to stop states from treating TANF grants as a slush fund for unrelated priorities.

### EITC/CTC
- [Allow advanced payment for both EITC and CTC](https://www.niskanencenter.org/advance-payment-of-the-eitc-lessons-from-an-international-perspective/)
- [Disentangle qualifying child component of EITC and put the savings into the CTC](https://www.niskanencenter.org/disentangling-in-work-and-child-tax-credits-to-address-improper-payments/)
    - This is a major driver of EITC improper payments ($21.9 billion in 2023, greater than all TANF funding)

### SNAP
- Loosen restrictions on hot meals for EBT cards
- [Allow flexible interview option for SNAP eligibility interviews](https://donmoynihan.substack.com/p/making-snap-interviews-more-flexible)

### Social Security
- Reinstate the Windfall Elimination Provision/Government Pension Offset (fiscal madness this was repealed!).
- [Reliable Predictable Security (RPS)](https://manhattan.institute/article/rejuvenating-social-security-a-better-option-for-future-generations)
    - Individuals under 45 can opt for a simple flat benefit (indexed to inflation) that is 25% above the FPL in exchange for 5% payroll tax cut for the remainder of their working years
- The CBO's possible Social Security reforms [here](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-12/60557-budget-options.pdf) seem reasonable too?

## Major Reforms

### Increase agricultural R&D funding

- Agricultural TFP growth has slowed down. Was 1-2% per year for second half of 20th century but [has averaged 0.69% per year since 2000](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/agricultural-productivity-in-the-united-states).
- Given current population growth, unless TFP growth picks up again we'll have to choose between clear-cutting forests (bad for climate change) and famine in the developing world.
- Public sector agricultural R&D took a huge cut after the GFC. Private sector has picked up the tab but mostly in applied research, not the basic research that has historically led to high TFP growth.
- 2020s and 2030s likely defined by higher deficits, so appropriating more ag R&D funding risky. Can be budget neutral if it comes out of crop subsidies (see below)
- [Ag R&D return estimated between 17% to 67% over postwar period](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/75A079865598B5C6BC11C85321E7FBAF/S107407081700013Xa.pdf/research-productivity-and-output-growth-in-us-agriculture.pdf).
- Current breakdown of federal agricultural R&D spending:
    - **Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research (FFAR)**
        - Private/public partnership where private investment matches federal spending $1.40 for every $1
    - **AgARDA**
        - Established in 2018, has yet to see any funding
        - ARPA model program for moonshot projects
    - **National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)**
        - Capacity grants to land grant universities, agricultural experiment stations, and cooperative extension services
        - $1.86 of state/local spending for every $1 of fedderal spending
    - **Commodity checkoff programs**
        - These programs spend money on R&D but they are not obligated to spend any fixed percent.
        - Ideally we'd get rid of checkoff programs entirely but amending 1996 Commodity Promotion Act to require high percentage of collected checkoff fees to go to R&D would be a second best solution.

### Reform approval process for GM crops and other foodtech innovations

- Pseudoscientific panic over GM crops in the 90s by the EU has led to a significantly harsher regulatory regime for novel food technology around the world.
- GM crops contributed [$225.1 billion in economic impact from 1996-2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21645698.2020.1779574) in nominal terms.
    - That seems somewhat low but few countries allow GM crops at all and the ones that do have approved relatively few crop varieties.
- Agricultural biotech approval runs through at most three agencies (USDA, EPA, FDA). Consolidating approval into a single office or creating a coordinating office for approvals (as in the proposed Agricultural Biotechnology Coordination Act) would be a good first step.
- Experts [support product-based rather than process-based regulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215017X19306599?via%3Dihub). Approval for novel biotech should be based on traits, such that traits that are substantially equivalent to existing products but produced via different methods should not require premarket approval.
    - Should be technology independent. Not just for gene editing (Agrobacterium, CRISPR) but for any novel agricultural biotech product like biostimulants, feed additives, precision fermentation etc. This was a flaw with the USDA's recent SECURE rule.
    - Plant-incorporated protectants (PIP) approval at the EPA should have a similar process
    - This matches the current approval process in Canada
- USDA approval should preempt state law (ex: undo all the cellular meat bans in red states)
- Establish a framework at the WTO for reciprocal approval of GM crops from overseas and try to strongarm the holdouts (EU, China but less so recently) to accept GM crops as safe under Codex Alimentarius standards.

### Cut crop subsidies

- The WTO's Agreement on Agriculture classifies public stockholding schemes as Amber Box policies. US farm subsidies have shifted from purchasing agricultural surplus to essentially a separate and very generous welfare system for the agricultural industry (FCIP, ARC, PLC etc).
- Crop subsidies are not necessary for high yields. Australia and New Zealand zeroed out crop subsidies in the 70s/80s and today are major agricultural exporters.
- [Total value of crop subsidies is an average of $17.6 billion a year](https://usafacts.org/articles/federal-farm-subsidies-what-data-says/). We should be putting as much of that into Ag R&D as possible.
- If full repeal is politically impossible, [Ed Dolan had good intermediate suggestions for crop insurance specifically](https://dolanecon.blogspot.com/2018/05/crop-insurance-should-die-yet-it-lives.html):
    - Eliminate yield exclusion
    - Stricter caps on high income farms
    - Eliminate harvest-price option

### End the Renewable Fuel Standard

- First generation biofuels are a failed technology. Bad for the climate, bad for consumers, bad for food and energy costs. It's pure public choice dynamics that cause it to persist.
- [$163.8 billion in excessive cost to consumers over ten years](https://www.rstreet.org/research/the-consumer-costs-and-climate-impacts-of-the-rfs/)
- Contributes 2-3% rise in corn prices per billion gallons of ethanol
- Intermediate reform could be [setting the blend requirement window to be multiple years](https://ifp.org/biofuel-mandates-raise-food-and-energy-prices/) rather than one so refiners can exploit price fluctuations.

### End agricultural protectionism (tariffs, AD/CVD, regulatory protectionism)

- [Cost of all MFN tariff rates on agricultural products is roughly $3.5 billion per year](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2021/june/how-the-removal-of-tariffs-would-impact-agricultural-trade).
    - Doesn't include cost of AD/CVD duties and regulatory protectionism
- Particularly egregious examples: US Sugar Program, FSIS requiring continuous inspection for catfish (but not other fish), high TRQs on animal products, and of course the Trump tariffs on coffee and bananas.

### H-2A visa program reform

- H-2A program was designed on the assumption that seasonal agricultural workers would be competing with local workers for jobs when in reality not even American prisoners want to do farm labor.
- [There are a number of ways to make the program better for both workers and farmers](https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/old_uploads/2018/01/H2A-Policy-Brief.pdf)
    - Allow H-2A workers to change employers
    - Expand H-2A to non-seasonal work (dairies, meatpacking, forestry)
    - Axe the Adverse Effect Wage Rule (AEWR)
    - Add a grace period for the start of the visa
    - Create a pathway to citizenship

### USDA/FDA standardize food expiration labels

- No standards on expiration labels currently and misleading Best By labels used in inventory management by grocers [contribute ~$7 billion in food waste due to consumer confusion](https://chlpi.org/news-and-events/news-and-commentary/food-law-and-policy/confusion-over-food-date-labels-has-grown-according-to-new-national-survey/).
- Compared to other food labeling initiatives (COOL, National Organic Program, GMO) this would actually have a positive ROI.

## Minor Reforms

### NOAA streamlines offshore aquaculture permits

- Getting an offshore aquaculture permit is a [confusing nightmare](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R45952) currently and there are proposed bills to rectify this but my priors are that the cost of offshore oceanic aquaculture will likely exceed the potential profit in most cases.

### End all commodity checkoff programs and marketing order programs

- These are cartel-like and engage in a lot of questionable lobbying but their power to directly manipulate prices has been dramatically scaled back.

### Repeal the Onion Futures Act

- The fact we have one agricultural commodity we can't sell futures contracts for due to a historical quirk is dumb but the upside to an onion futures market is probably low.

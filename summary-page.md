    - [Reform EPA's rule for plant-incorporated protectants (PIPs)](https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/food-agriculture-environment/regulations-must-improve-to-help-crops-resist-disease) to harmonize with USDA definition of conventional breeding, narrow scope of plant regulators and disease resistance genes subject to the rule, and reduce unnecessary tiers of exemptions

# Political System and Elections

## Ideal (Unrealistic) System

- Replace existing US political institutions with a proportional Westminster system.
    - House of Representatives is elected via PR, ideally MMPR with districts allowed to cross state boundaries
    - Increase size of House to ~670 seats to match cube root law
    - Turn the Senate into an unelected advisory body like the UK House of Lords or Canadian Senate
    - Eliminate the presidency completely and replace with either a prime minister elected by the House or a directorial council with representatives from each state a la Switzerland
        - Presidential systems are inherently unstable (Juan Linz, "Perils of Presidentialism")
- State governments should also be under a PR system
- Eliminate local government entirely. Mayors are appointed by governors.
- Above is infeasible due to requiring numerous constitutional changes

## Feasible voting system reforms

### Move to open-list PR for House elections

- MMPR would be tricky due to requiring overhang seats and vulnerable to decoy list strategies, both of which seem at odds with our decentralized election infrastructure
- Requires amending Uniform Congressional District Act to allow multimember districts (district magnitude of 5?) with a proportionality requirement to avoid a return to bloc voting and probably also axing the current redistricting interpretation of the VRA. The PR law would likely be open-ended on implementation, so states would choose various systems (STV, OLPR, closed list, single member districts with independent commission) but would hopefully converge to OLPR in a world where proportionality is enforced.
- Increasing the House's size also necessary. Wyoming Rule would likely be politically feasible.
- [A good first step would be state legislatures and local governments adopting OLPR as a proof of concept](https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/reforming-big-city-elections.pdf)
- The challenge is that Americans dislike the idea of parties being a formal part of the voting process, even though that's critical to enacting PR. [OLPR is an easier sell than closed list](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/toward-a-different-kind-of-party-government/).

### Cardinal voting or a Condorcet compliant method for single winner elections (Senate/Pres)

- Existence of single-winner Senate and Presidential elections would likely still result in lower ENP than expected even with PR in the House
- Trickier to impose a federal mandate on single winner voting systems like you can with proportionality in the House.
    - In a world where the House is elected proportionally, the ENP is likely larger and we have our equivalent to LibDems/NDP, so there may be more political buy-in for single-winner voting reform
- Two options for single winner reform
    - Cardinal voting system like approval or STAR
    - Condorcet compliant method like [Ned Foley's top 3 proposal](https://edwardbfoley.substack.com/p/the-case-for-condorcet-voting-is)
- Definitely shouldn't do IRV for a host of reasons
    - Center squeeze
    - Poor batch summability
    - High rates of ballot spoilage
    - Fails participation criterion (and is vulnerable to a one person, one vote legal challenge)
    - Susceptible to vote buying
    - Disliked by election workers and costly to administer
- As with PR, implementing for state/local elections would be a good proof of concept
- [PR can coexist with presidentialism](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/70/pr-and-presidentialism-yes-we-can/) (Uruguay, Costa Rica, Chile after Pinochet)

## Improving Congressional capacity

- Congress has lost a lot of power vis-a-vis the presidency in part due to declining capacity. Some of this is judicial (unitary executive theory, INS v. Chadha) but some of it is poor legislative efficiency de facto transferring power to the executive.
- The transition from transformative legislature to arena legislature is probably irreversible. Politics is too optimized now, constituent services is more valuable for reelection than policy shop work. But there are some low hanging fruit for improving legislative efficiency.
- Possible reform ideas:
    - Modify the Congressional calendar and implement block scheduling for committees (see [BPC's proposal](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/optimizing-the-u-s-congressional-calendar-to-boost-legislative-productivity/))
    - [Modify House MRA to have the same flexibility as the Senate's SOPOEA](https://www.newamerica.org/political-reform/reports/congressional-brain-drain/lessons-for-congressional-capacity-reform) and in general increase pay & possibly index it to inflation
    - Increase funding for Congressional support offices (GAO, CRS, CBO) which have seen underinvestment since Gingrich's lobotomy in the 90s
        - GAO saves $100 for every $1 it receives
        - Could create a [Congressional Regulatory Office (CRO)](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-case-for-a-congressional-regulation-office) for retrospective review of executive rulemaking
        - [Could also resurrect the OTA](https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Final-128-1-1.pdf), but it might be simpler to roll that capacity into CRS
        - Ban on congressional stocktrading could be a sweetener for any funding increase
            - A better alternative to banning congressional stocktrading would be tying pay bonuses to a group of metrics (GDP growth, unemployment rate, etc) though this might cause these metrics to be gamed a la Goodhart's Law
    - Change House rules to promote bipartisanship
        - End requirement that discharge petition signatures be disclosed daily
        - Lower threshold for Rules Committee consideration of bipartisan amendments from 20 on each side to 10

## Reigning in the executive's power

- After Trump, we need a way to prevent the executive from becoming a de facto dictator in the absence of congressional capacity
- Reforms to consider ([many of which were in 2021's PODA](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/protecting-our-democracy-act-2/)):
    - [Article One Act limiting national emergency powers](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/the-article-one-act/)
        - National emergencies can last 30 days only and can only be extended with Congressional approval
        - Without Congressional approval, the same national emergency cannot be declared for the duration of the president's term
        - Extended emergencies have regular reporting requirements (every 6 months)
        - Extended emergencies can only last for one year before requiring reapproval
    - Add Congressional approval requirement to Insurrection Act exemptions to Posse Comitatus Act
    - Limit presidential pardons. No self-pardons and potentially Congressional approval on all pardons.
    - Transfer control of DC national guard to the DC mayor
    - Create right of action for House/Senate to sue emoluments clause violations
    - Create right of action for House/Senate to sue subpoena non-compliance
    - IGs can only be fired for cause and the courts should appoint acting IGs, not the executive
    - GAO, GPO, and Library of Congress heads appointed by Congress, not the executive

## Minor reforms

### Repurpose the Presidential Election Campaign Fund (PECF) as a mechanism to fund election standardization across the states

- BPC full proposal [here](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/reimagining-federal-election-funding/).
- Block grants for election administration should come with [strings attached](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AchievableFederalElectionReformV2.pdf), namely:
    - Voter list maintenance conducted at regular intervals
    - Bans on voter caging
    - At least seven days of early voting
    - Automatic Voter Registration (AVR)
    - Preprocessing vote-by-mail ballots at least seven days before election day
    - Conduct audits after every federal election
    - Voter ID requirement
        - This now benefits Dems on net, ironically

### Eliminate sore loser laws

- Parties good, primaries bad. I think this is far lower value than pushing for PR though.

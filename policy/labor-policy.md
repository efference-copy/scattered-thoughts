# Labor Policy

## Some misc thoughts on labor policy

- Wage labor has a tendency to be moralized relative to other areas of the economy. The folk view is that wages compensate the disutility of labor, that there is a just wage for any given labor task, and much of what is wrong with our economy stems from a disconnect between the ideal just wage and actual wages.
    - Not all labor is distasteful - indeed, many people genuinely enjoy their job and so wages are not purely compensation for disutility.
    - [It's better to conceptualize wages as a mechanism for channeling labor towards its highest and best use](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4aa5/2616102f4655aa97ab68c0e54057ffb22464.pdf). Labor income compensates workers for opportunity cost, not disutility.
- This tendency to moralize is particularly prominent when it comes to automation. The long-term trend of industrialization is capital-labor substitution, replacing labor intensive tasks with machines. Automation has not resulted in a permanent increase in unemployment because the the efficiency gains from automation have to go _somewhere_ - investors who profit from replacing human workers with self-serve kiosks at McDonald's will either reinvest that profit or spend it on personal consumption, both of which create labor demand.
    - A permanent increase in unemployment due to automation is only possible if human desire could ever be fully satiated. So far humans have had no problem finding something new to spend money on, no matter how frivolous.
- The primary object of labor market policy should be minimizing unemployment because 1) it is empirically the most effective way of improving bargaining power and working conditions for workers, 2) it incentives capital-labor substitution, and 3) long-term unemployment is incredibly damaging to future economic prospects. Cyclical unemployment is a product of business cycles (and thus better addressed with monetary policy). Labor market policy should thus focus on reducing structural unemployment.
- I used to be much more favorable towards sectoral bargaining as a solution to unemployment but labor market rigidity in Europe has changed my opinion. Making firing more difficult results in less hiring (especially at the junior level) and greater difficulty in corporate restructuring. As a result Europe has persistantly higher unemployment compared to the US.
    - Denmark and Sweden's flexicurity system (easier to do layoffs but with generous UI/retraining programs/ALMP for those workers that are laid off) has resulted in lower unemployment and higher wages compared to the rest of Europe.
    - Sectoral unions compress wages across entire industries, creating greater search frictions and less incentives to job-hop
    - [Members-only unionism](https://prospect.org/justice/labor-crossroads-defense-members-only-unionism/) is an alternative to sectoral unionism that could potentially reduce the barrier to union formation without the common pathologies of sectoral/enterprise unionism
- There is a lot of heated debate currently about whether labor markets can be modeled as a monopsony. If a labor market is a monopsony, then increasing the minimum wage can be welfare-maximizing. I'm somewhat ambivalent about this debate because policies targeting structural unemployment seem much higher ROI than increasing the minimum wage. The federal minimum wage hasn't budged but median wages skyrocketed post-Covid due to a tightening labor market.
- Griggs v Duke is usually blamed for excessive credentialism in the modern labor market but [the comparative evidence for that is weak](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/26/dont-blame-griggs/).

## Smoothing out labor shocks

### Expand UI benefit generosity
- I like the [Niskanen proposal](https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/A-UI-System-That-Works-Final.pdf)
    - Minimum benefit is 35% of state's median household income
    - Replace 75% of each dollar earned above the minimum benefit
    - Maximum benefit is 100% of state's median household income
    - Last up to 39 weeks

### Eliminate experience rating for UI
- Experience rating is unusual for UI systems in other countries. Most countries fund UI with a flat payroll tax. [A flat 2% would be more than sufficient as a replacement](https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Creating-a-more-dynamic-unemployment-insurance-system.pdf).
- Experience rating came about during Great Depression, when understanding of business cycles was rooted in “overproduction” rather than monetary theory.
- TEFRA set a high maximum tax rate for SUTA. This is undesirable as a uniform tax, so most states turned towards variable tax schemes of which experience rating came to dominate.

### Increase federal funding (FUTA) for program administration to the states
- SUTA funds UI benefits themselves, but FUTA funds UI administration and is levied directly by the federal government
- SUTA revenue flows to Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund (UTF). FUTA funds flow into a separate UTF account, ESAA.
- [We should maintain 80/20 split on FUTA for program administration vs Extended Benefits rather than allowing EB to double dip into FUTA funds](https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Getting-the-job-done-on-unemployment-insurance-How-Congress-can-reinforce-program-administration-and-integrity-4-1.pdf)
- Instead of using a Resource Justification Model to disburse ESAA funds, states should be entitled to the FUTA revenue they raise themselves.
- We should also expand the FUTA wage base ($7k to $14k) and index it to inflation.

### Broaden eligibility criteria for Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessment (RESEA)
- RESEA is a federal-state grant program for interventions to reduce unemployment duration
- UI claimants under RESEA meet with jobs counselor and are given info about one-stop center and labor market data in city, and work with jobs counselor to develop reemployment plan.
- RESEA is a mandatory program for UI claimants considered at highest risk for losing benefits using Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services (WPRS) algorithms, those these models haven’t been updated in decades.
- [The BRIDGE for Workers Act](https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-bridge-for-workers-act-getting-people-back-into-jobs-fast/) allows states to target any UI claimant for RESEA, not just those identified by WPRS
Utilization of job center resources early is critical as most job seekers are unduly optimistic about unemployment duration

### Increase funding for US Employment Service (the primary Active Labor Market Policy instrument for the US)
- US only spends ~0.11% of GDP on ALMPs, among the lowest in the OECD.
    - This may be in part due to our fairly large, diverse internal market. ALMPs are perhaps more useful in small countries with undiversified industries.
- [The ELEVATE Act](https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-elevate-act-explained-a-job-guarantee-that-can-work/) that was proposed a couple years ago had some ALMP provisions like relocation assistance and subsidies for hiring costs.

### Require employers to issue separation certificate whenever an employee is separated from a job
- White paper [here](https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Separation-anxiety-Reducing-improper-payments-in-unemployment-insurance-with-a-separation-certificate.pdf)
- GAO says UI improper payment rate is 15.6% in 2024
- Canada’s Record of Employment (ROE) system requires employers to issue separation certificates, resulting in an improper payment rate of ~5%
- State agencies rely on a mix of paper and digital communications after claims are submitted. There is a digital platform SIDES that employers can submit information to but uptake is still limited.
- Majority of improper payments are caused by delays in receiving information from employers
Feds could mandate employers submit a Separation Certificate whenever an employee becomes separated from a job. This could leverage the existing SIDES system.
- Compliance with UI reporting is low, particularly among small businesses. Any Separation Certificate system would need to be relatively simple and intuitive to use while also assessing fines for non-compliance.

### Wage insurance
- Not many examples of this worldwide. Adverse selection makes private wage insurance infeasible.
- [The Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance program in the US is the best example of a successful wage insurance program](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-10-14/wage-insurance-helps-workers-more-than-blocking-automation-and-imports?srnd=opinion&sref=1pnqJ0TR). Available for older workers, it paid the difference between the pre- and post-separation wages for two years. This is different from TAA which was just a retraining program combined with extended UI benefits. The Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance program actually paid for itself with higher tax receipts and lower UI payments to program recipients.
- A full wage insurance system would be neutral as to the cause of unemployment, and not just be limited to trade-based shocks.
- [There is a risk employers could lower wage offers](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2024/07/wage-insurance-a-potential-policy-for-displaced-workers/) knowing that a portion of applicants will receive subsidies. This is true for wage subsidies too though.

## Improve labor market flexibility

### Universal Recognition of occupational licenses
- [Total cost of state occupational licensing is ~$200 billion per year](https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Licensure_Report_WEB.pdf)
- Universal recognition regime (sans residency requirements or substantial equivalency requirements) is preferable to interstate compacts, which [tends to bias the strictest requirements](https://edwardjtimmons.substack.com/p/why-we-should-stop-promoting-licensing)

### Ban non-competes
- In theory non-competes can compensate for the cost of employee training, but [research is showing that doesn't really happen in practice](https://eig.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Noncompete-Clauses-A-Policymakers-Guide.pdf).
- An intermediate option could be requiring employers to provide an explicit upfront buyout price so workers can predictably exit the agreements when better job offers come along.
